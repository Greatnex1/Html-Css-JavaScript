Concepts in Functional Programming : <br>
       a) Pure  functions : A function, no matter how many times it is called, remains the same.
        Impure function occurs if the function returns different results despite passing the same values into it.
        E.g Trying to make a call to a service that has unique properties everytime to prevent
        the broswer from caching the result.
        Pure functions do not change or mutate object that are accessible outside the function.
        
       b) Immutability: An imporant concept of functional programming that an object is unchanged or mutated. 

       c) Declarative Over Imperative Code : <br> 
       imperative code
       goes through the steps to describe how to achieve the desired result. While declarative
       code focuses on what should happen to the data, the details of how it should work are
       abstracted away.
